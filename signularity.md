## What is Singularity?

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity):

> Singularity is the hypothesis that accelerating progress in technologies such as artificial intelligence will cause non-human intelligence to exceed human intelligence for the first time in history, causing human civilization to be radically changed or possibly destroyed

I will be collecting a list of books, stories, articles and movies regarding singularity, artificial intelligence (AI) and robots. Why would I not?

A growing list of website ideas. It would be great if someone created these so I could use them.

## "Catch Me Up" Movie Website

A website that allows a movie viewer that needs a plot refresher or if they started watching a movie half-way through they can get the crib notes for what they missed. The website would show a list of movie plot lines and all will be obscured by spoiler tags. Each line of plot details will have an associated minute. The user will be able to reveal the plot lines they want to see.

## Sports Scores website with Spoiler Alerts

I tried this once for the EPL but struggled to find a free reliable API source.

## Image Depot

Buy image rights with very small amounts of bitcoins or stellar. We are talking fractions of a penny.

## Cheat/Crib Sheet for Areas of Expertise

A pocket sized cheat sheet to print out explaining a specific subject. For example a small printout for baseball explaining the most basic rules and facts plus a few small trivia pieces. A way for someone to quickly get a summary of a subject in order to have a conversation about the topic.

## API Security/Hacker Game

A game that has developers try to hack into APIs. It would be a fun way of teaching API security. There are many security games already out there but this one would be focused on APIs.

# Crowd Source Live Sports Scores API

You have to pay for a live sports scores API. What if we created a free API that was populated by the consumers who in turn use the live scores. There could be endpoints for reporting game events. When a game event has enough reports to be considered accurate it would be returned in the API as an verified event. This is basically how the big sports data companies get there data but they rely on about two people per game. A free API would have the world available for reporting. In order to pay for its own hosting maybe it could charge for web-hooks on live events or donations.
